# Hexiconic Project Overview (Nontechnical)

This document explains Hexiconic in plain language for people who are not part of the development team.

## What Hexiconic Is

Hexiconic is a calm, progression-based word puzzle game for mobile.  
Players solve short word challenges, earn gems, and move through a long sequence of handcrafted puzzle chapters.

The design goal is simple:

- Keep gameplay mentally engaging
- Reduce frustration
- Make steady progress feel rewarding

## The Core Player Experience

Each puzzle shows seven letters in a honeycomb shape.

Players form words by:

- Using the required center letter
- Building words with 3 or more letters
- Reusing letters as needed

As players find valid words, they earn:

- Points (for puzzle completion)
- Gems (an in-game resource)

Players complete a puzzle by reaching a target score threshold, not by finding every possible word. This keeps the game approachable and helps players avoid getting stuck.

## Why People Keep Playing

Hexiconic is built around a clear loop:

1. Solve words
2. Earn points and gems
3. Spend gems on hints when needed
4. Complete the puzzle
5. Move to the next puzzle

This loop gives players regular wins while still allowing depth for more skilled players.

## Progression Model

The game is structured as a long chapter journey:

- 5,000+ total puzzles
- Chapters arranged to create a smoother difficulty curve
- Save progress so players can leave and return anytime

Instead of offering one puzzle per day, Hexiconic is designed for players who want longer sessions and ongoing progression.

## Hint and Economy Design

Hints are powered by gems, which players earn through normal play.

Design intent:

- Hints should prevent dead-ends
- Spending decisions should feel meaningful
- Players should still feel the satisfaction of discovery

Additional reward systems currently include:

- Daily reward claim
- Optional rewarded ad for extra gems

## Tone and Product Direction

Hexiconic is intentionally:

- Relaxing rather than high-pressure
- Rewarding rather than punishing
- Structured rather than random

It combines the comfort of familiar word games with a stronger sense of long-term progression.

## Current State

Hexiconic is already playable and in active development.

Current focus areas:

- UI polish
- Progress feedback improvements
- Long-term meta systems (collection/replay-style features)

## One-Sentence Summary

Hexiconic is a mobile word game that pairs calm puzzle-solving with long-term progression, letting players keep moving forward without requiring perfect completion.
